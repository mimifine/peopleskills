## üìã Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Environment Variables File

Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root directory with the following content:

```bash
# =============================================================================
# SUPABASE CONFIGURATION FOR PEOPLE SKILLS PLATFORM
# =============================================================================
# 
# To get these values:
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com and sign in
# 2. Select your project (or create a new one)
# 3. Go to Settings > API
# 4. Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
# 5. Replace the values below
#
# =============================================================================

# Your Supabase project URL (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here

# Your Supabase anon/public key (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# =============================================================================
# APP CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important:** Replace `your_supabase_project_url_here` and `your_supabase_anon_key_here` with your actual Supabase credentials.

### Step 2: Set Up Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Copy the entire contents of `database-schema.sql` from your project
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** to execute all the SQL commands
7. Verify the table was created by going to **Table Editor** and looking for `talent_profiles`

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

After creating the `.env.local` file, restart your development server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Open your app in the browser (usually http://localhost:3000)
2. Navigate to the "Add Talent" section
3. Fill out just the **Full Name** field (leave everything else blank)
4. Click **Submit**
5. Check the browser console for success/error messages
6. Go to your Supabase dashboard > Table Editor > talent_profiles to see the new record

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Missing Supabase environment variables"

**Symptoms:** Error in console about missing environment variables

**Solution:**
- Make sure `.env.local` file exists in project root
- Verify the file name is exactly `.env.local` (not `.env` or `.env.local.txt`)
- Restart your development server after creating the file
- Check that the environment variable names are correct (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" (RLS error)

**Symptoms:** Error code 42501 when trying to insert data

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard > Authentication > Policies
2. Find the `talent_profiles` table
3. Make sure you have an INSERT policy named "Enable insert for all users"
4. If not, create it with:
   - Policy name: "Enable insert for all users"
   - Operation: INSERT
   - USING expression: `true`
   - WITH CHECK expression: `true`

### Issue 3: "relation does not exist"

**Symptoms:** Error code 42P01 when trying to insert data

**Solution:**
- Run the database schema SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
- Verify the `talent_profiles` table exists in Table Editor
- Check that all columns are present with correct data types

### Issue 4: "Authentication failed"

**Symptoms:** Connection errors or authentication failures

**Solution:**
- Verify your Supabase project URL is correct (no trailing slashes)
- Make sure you're using the anon key, not the service role key
- Check that your Supabase project is active
- Restart your development server

### Issue 5: Form validation errors for optional fields

**Symptoms:** Getting errors when leaving fields blank

**Solution:**
- The updated code should handle this automatically
- Only the `full_name` field is required
- All other fields should be optional and not cause validation errors
- Empty strings are converted to `null` for database storage

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Minimal Data Submission
1. Fill out only the "Full Name" field
2. Leave all other fields blank
3. Submit the form
4. Should succeed without any validation errors

### Test 2: Partial Data Submission
1. Fill out "Full Name" and a few other fields
2. Leave some fields blank
3. Submit the form
4. Should succeed and store null values for blank fields

### Test 3: Full Data Submission
1. Fill out all fields with valid data
2. Submit the form
3. Should succeed and store all data properly

### Test 4: Social Media Data
1. Fill out Instagram and/or TikTok handles
2. Add follower counts
3. Submit the form
4. Check that socials JSONB field contains the data

## üîç Verification Commands

Run these SQL queries in your Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything is working:

```sql
-- Check if table exists and has correct structure
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'talent_profiles'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'talent_profiles';

-- Check if policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'talent_profiles';

-- Check recent talent profiles
SELECT * FROM talent_profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

After completing this setup, you should be able to:

‚úÖ **Submit forms with just a name** - No validation errors for blank optional fields  
‚úÖ **Submit forms with partial data** - Only filled fields are stored, others are null  
‚úÖ **Submit forms with full data** - All data is properly stored  
‚úÖ **See success messages** - Clear feedback when submissions succeed  
‚úÖ **See helpful error messages** - Specific guidance when things go wrong  
‚úÖ **View data in Supabase** - New records appear in the talent_profiles table  
‚úÖ **Handle social media data** - Instagram/TikTok data stored as JSONB

## üÜò Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Check the terminal** where you're running `npm run dev` for server errors
3. **Verify your Supabase project** is active and accessible
4. **Double-check environment variables** are correct and the file is named properly

## üìù Next Steps

Once your Supabase integration is working:

1. **Test with real data** - Add some actual talent profiles
2. **Customize the form** - Add or modify fields as needed
3. **Add authentication** - Implement user login/signup
